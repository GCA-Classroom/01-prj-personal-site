    <p>
      <!-- Write a short introduction about yourself here -->
      <!-- Corrected spelling errors below -->
      Denver, CO native currently attending Metropolitan State University of Denver pursuing an undergraduate degree in Video Production and Journalism. I am passionate about helping and caring for others, so I work as a Home Healthcare Aide for senior adults and as a MY Denver Youth instructor with the Parks and Recreation of the City and County of Denver. The love of my life comes from two dogs named Brown Suga Baby (Schnoodle) and Mister Suga Daddy (Toy Poodle). During my free time, I edit videos and design personalized Canva designs for major music artists. Learning is essential to my soul, and I believe that without an open mind and a willingness to continue educating yourself, you will not be able to live your dream life. I am excited to be a part of The Global Accelerator's Program so I am able to learn new ways of communicating and new technologies as AI advances!

        My Mother & Grandmother
      </li>
      <li>Growing up as an only child, raised by a single parent mother, my strength, compassion, and determination came from these two women. They taught me that there would always be someone better than me, and that helped instill the confidence I needed to always be originally myself. Today, I have the pleasure to care for these two as they always have for me. We all enjoy cooking together, going on road trips, and planning holiday events. They have been very supportive throughout my education journey and cheer me on every step of the way. My main goal is to make them proud and to show them what they have taught me will never go unnoticed. I love you Momma and Granny!</li>
